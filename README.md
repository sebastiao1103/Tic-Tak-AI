## Features
- âœ” **Multiplayer**: Play against another human.
- âœ” **Basic Bot**: Bot plays immediate wins.
- âœ” **Minimax AI**: Uses the Minimax algorithm to play optimally.
- âœ” **MCTS AI**: Uses Monte Carlo Tree Search for decision-making.

## Installation ðŸš€
Clone the repository and build the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xTijan/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
cd tic-tac-toe-ai
cargo build
```

Run the game:

```sh
cargo run
```

## Game Modes ðŸŽ®

### 1. Multiplayer
Two players take turns on the same terminal.

### 2. Basic Bot
The bot takes opportunities for immediate wins and blocks the opponent's immediate wins; otherwise, it plays randomly.

### 3. Minimax AI
A strategy-based AI that always plays optimally by evaluating the best possible move using the Minimax algorithm.

### 4. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) AI
An AI that uses Monte Carlo simulations to determine the best move. It balances exploration and exploitation to refine its strategy.


## AI Algorithms

### Minimax
The **Minimax algorithm** evaluates all possible moves, selecting the one that maximizes the AIâ€™s chance of winning while minimizing the opponentâ€™s best options. It guarantees perfect play but can be computationally expensive.

ðŸ‘‰ Full explanation in [./minimax.md](minimax.md).

### Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
Unlike Minimax, **MCTS uses simulations** to statistically determine the best move, making it effective for large game spaces.

ðŸ‘‰ Full breakdown in [./mcts.md](mcts.md).
